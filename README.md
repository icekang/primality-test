# primality-test
Digital Logic for Primality Test
an extra excercise from my class, Digital Logic Laboratory.
I used simulation program called LogicWorks.
to use my program just hit clr on the first time you open it and use the input, Hex Keyboard to enter a number.
While program is running please don't change the input becuase I was too lazy to do another register for that variable :)
Have fun!
