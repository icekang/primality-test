Digital Logic for Primality Test <br>
an extra excercise from my class, Digital Logic Laboratory. <br>
I used simulation program called LogicWorks. <br>
to use my program just hit clr on the first time you open it and use the input, Hex Keyboard to enter a number. <br>
While program is running please don't change the input becuase I was too lazy to do another register for that variable :) <br>
Have fun!
